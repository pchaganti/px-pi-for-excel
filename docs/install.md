# Install Pi for Excel

No coding or dev tools required — just download one file and add it to Excel.

## 1) Download the manifest file

Download this file and save it somewhere you can find it (e.g. your Desktop):

👉 **[manifest.prod.xml](https://pi-for-excel.vercel.app/manifest.prod.xml)**

## 2) Add it to Excel

### macOS

1. Open Finder and press **Cmd + Shift + G** (Go to Folder)
2. Paste this path and press Enter:
   ```
   ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/wef
   ```
3. Copy `manifest.prod.xml` into that folder
4. Quit Excel completely (Cmd + Q) and reopen it
5. Go to **Insert → My Add-ins** — you should see **Pi for Excel**
6. Click it to open

> **Folder doesn't exist?** Create it first — open Terminal and run:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/wef
> ```
> Then repeat from step 3.

### Windows

You can try to install and run this on Windows — it might work!

1. Open Excel
2. Go to **Insert → My Add-ins**
3. Click **Upload My Add-in…**
4. Select the `manifest.prod.xml` file you downloaded
5. Click **Open Pi** in the ribbon

## 3) First-run check

1. Open the taskpane (`Open Pi` button)
2. Connect a provider (see below)
3. Send a test prompt, e.g.:
   - `What sheet am I currently on?`
   - `Summarize my current selection`

If you get a response, install is complete.

## 4) Connect a provider

### Recommended (easiest): API key

For most users, API keys are the smoothest setup and usually do **not** need the proxy helper.

1. In Pi, run `/login` (or use the welcome screen)
2. Expand a provider row (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, etc.)
3. Paste your API key
4. Click **Save**

### OAuth / account login (Anthropic, GitHub Copilot)

1. In `/login`, click **Login with …**
2. Complete login in the browser window that opens
3. Return to Excel and complete any prompt shown

If login fails with a CORS/network error, follow the next section.

## OAuth logins and CORS helper

Some OAuth/token endpoints are blocked by CORS inside Office webviews (especially on macOS WKWebView).

Typical symptoms:
- `Login was blocked by browser CORS`
- `Load failed`
- `Failed to fetch`

### What to do

1. Run a local HTTPS proxy helper on the same machine as Excel (defaults to `https://localhost:3003`):

```bash
npm run proxy:https
```

If the user is non-technical, a teammate/admin can run this step for them on their machine.

2. In Pi, open `/settings` → **Proxy**:
   - enable **Use CORS Proxy**
   - set URL to `https://localhost:3003`

3. Retry OAuth login

Notes:
- Keep the proxy URL on **HTTPS** (`https://...`), not HTTP.
- API-key providers generally work without proxy.
- If port `3003` is busy, run with another port and use that same URL in settings:

```bash
PORT=3005 npm run proxy:https
```

## Updates

If you installed with `manifest.prod.xml`, Pi for Excel loads from a hosted URL and most updates are automatic.

- Normal case: close/reopen Excel taskpane to pick up latest version.
- Rare case (manifest changes): download the new `manifest.prod.xml` and upload it again in Excel.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pi does not appear in My Add-ins
- Re-open Excel and try again
- Ensure you uploaded `manifest.prod.xml` (not the localhost dev manifest)

### Taskpane opens but is blank
- Your network may block `https://pi-for-excel.vercel.app`
- Try a different network / VPN setting

### I installed, but changes are not visible
- Close and reopen Excel to clear cached taskpane state

### OAuth login still fails
- Confirm proxy is running and reachable at the exact URL in `/settings`
- Confirm proxy URL is `https://localhost:<port>` (not `http://`)
- Try API key auth as a fallback

## Developer setup (separate)

If you want to run from source (`localhost`, Vite, mkcert), use the root README: [Developer Quick Start](../README.md#developer-quick-start).
