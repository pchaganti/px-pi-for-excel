# v0.7.0-pre release notes

_Pre-release. Changes since `v0.6.1-pre`._

## Highlights

- **New add-ons and skills management UX**
  - Added a top-level **Add-ons** surface.
  - Added a **Skills catalog manager** and external-skill install/remove controls.
  - Added per-skill enable/disable controls and stale-cache handling for disabled skills.

- **OAuth improvements**
  - Added browser-safe OAuth flow for **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**.
  - Added browser-safe OAuth flows for **Google** providers.
  - Updated login guidance/docs for manual callback URL pasting where needed.

- **Files workspace improvements**
  - Added a **folder tree view** in the Files dialog.
  - Added stale scratch-file cleanup behavior.
  - Scoped workspace-context refresh to relevant artifacts.

## UX, accessibility, and safety

- Ran a broad sidebar/UI polish pass (focus, motion, semantics, labeling).
- Fixed context debug pill accessibility semantics:
  - header uses semantic button behavior,
  - now exposes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.
- Added regression coverage to guard context-pill ARIA wiring.
- Improved confirm-mode safety behavior when `window.confirm` is unavailable:
  - overlay-based approvals,
  - aborts respected while approvals are pending.

## Internal refactors

- Continued large-file modularization and extraction work in:
  - extension runtime/sandbox helpers,
  - extension API contracts/import helpers,
  - recovery format-state utilities,
  - shared bridge/network helpers.
- Bumped Pi dependencies to `0.52.12`.

## Notes

- This is a **feature-heavy pre-release** and is versioned as a minor pre-release bump.
- Recommended validation before broader rollout:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:models`
  - `npm run test:context`
  - `npm run test:security`
