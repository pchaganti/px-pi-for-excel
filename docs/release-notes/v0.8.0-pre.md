# v0.8.0-pre release notes

_Pre-release. Changes since `v0.7.0-pre`._

## Deploy catch-up snapshot

- Last successful Vercel deploy on `main`: `b5477bf` (2026-02-15, PR #309)
- This release batches **73 commits** since that deploy (**14 merged PRs** + 1 conflict-resolution merge commit)

## Highlights

- **Extensions + settings consolidation**
  - Tabbed Settings flow (`Logins`, `Extensions`, `More`)
  - Unified Extensions Hub promoted to primary surface
  - Skills external discovery graduated from experimental mode

- **Default-on integrations and web search improvements**
  - External tools now default to enabled
  - Web search now defaults to enabled
  - Jina added as the zero-config default provider, with fallback support and centralized endpoint host policy wiring

- **Files workspace overhaul (phase 1 + phase 2)**
  - Redesigned list/detail layout and simplified interaction model
  - Dual-source sections for workbook files and connected folders
  - Tree structure + folder grouping per section
  - Better guards around unsupported folder actions and path-only mutations

- **Local bridge UX and packaging upgrades**
  - Added/published `pi-for-excel-python-bridge` and `pi-for-excel-tmux-bridge` launcher packages
  - Default localhost bridge URLs and real-mode npx launchers
  - Kept Pyodide fallback available when the default bridge is offline
  - Graduated tmux from experimental gating in the settings flow

- **UI polish + consistency pass**
  - Replaced gear/add-ons emoji icons with Lucide SVG icons
  - Improved overlay/copy consistency and settings/disclosure parity
  - Removed `window.confirm` dependency in favor of overlay confirmations

- **Deploy policy restored and locked with tests**
  - Re-enabled normal Vercel auto-deploy behavior for `main` + PR previews
  - Kept non-PR feature branch deploys skipped
  - Added cross-platform regression coverage for `ignoreCommand`

## Internal quality work

- Continued large-file extraction/modularization work in UI/recovery/extensions paths.
- Added/expanded tests in extensions overlay DOM, proxy precedence, UI menu labels, and Vercel deploy policy behavior.

## Notes

- This is a **minor pre-release bump** due broad feature/delivery scope since `v0.7.0-pre`.
- Recommended validation before broader rollout:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:models`
  - `npm run test:context`
  - `npm run test:security`
