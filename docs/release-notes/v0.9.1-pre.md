# v0.9.1-pre release notes

_Pre-release. Changes since `v0.9.0-pre`._

## Highlights

- **Skills can now be self-authored from chat**
  - Extended core `skills` tool with `install` and `uninstall` actions.
  - `skills install` writes managed external skills to `skills/external/<name>/SKILL.md`.
  - `skills uninstall` removes managed external skills by name.
  - Tool now emits structured install/uninstall metadata for consistent UI rendering.
  - Skill-catalog updates dispatch runtime refresh events and invalidate stale skill-read cache entries.

- **Bundled extension-authoring guidance**
  - Added bundled `extending-pi` skill (`skills/extending-pi/SKILL.md`).
  - Added secure API-extension template guide (`docs/extensions-secure-connection-bundle.md`).
  - Guidance now defaults to `/tools → Connections` secret setup and host-managed auth flows.

- **Connection auth architecture hardening (Option B)**
  - Added host-injected auth path for extension `http.fetch(..., { connection })`.
  - Connection definitions now support `httpAuth` with strict `allowedHosts` allowlists.
  - Host enforces owner scoping + host allowlist before injecting auth headers.
  - 401/403 responses mark the connection as runtime auth-failed and surface structured connection errors.

- **Advanced secret-read escape hatch (capability-gated)**
  - Added `connections.getSecrets(connectionId)` for advanced/non-standard auth flows.
  - Added dedicated extension capability: `connections.secrets.read`.
  - Capability is treated as higher-risk and defaults to disabled.

## Notes

- This is a focused pre-release increment for issue #454:
  - self-authored skills from chat
  - bundled extension-authoring skill
  - secure connection/auth model improvements
